# 🏨 PMS Applications Validation Report

**Date:** September 22, 2025
**Status:** Applications Assessment In Progress

## 🔍 Current Deployment Analysis

### **What's Actually Running:**
- **Demo Containers:** Simple nginx containers serving basic HTML for ports 3010-3013
- **Backend Service:** Node.js service running on port 5000 with basic health endpoint

## 🚧 Current Issues Identified

### **1. Deployment Mismatch**
- **Problem:** Demo containers running instead of actual applications
- **Impact:** Can't test real PMS functionality
- **Solution:** Deploy actual Next.js applications

### **2. Backend Integration**
- **Problem:** Cyprus routes returning "Route not found"
- **Impact:** Cyprus features not accessible
- **Solution:** Verify backend deployment and route registration

### **3. Database Connection**
- **Problem:** Unknown if applications connect to databases
- **Impact:** No persistent data or real workflows
- **Solution:** Test database connectivity and data flows

### **4. Feature Completeness**
- **Problem:** Unknown if all features are implemented or just UI shells
- **Impact:** Can't validate against original vision
- **Solution:** Build and test each application thoroughly

## 📋 Validation Plan

### **Phase 1: Local Application Testing**
1. **Build all applications locally**
   - Install dependencies for each app
   - Build and run in development mode
   - Test core functionality

2. **Test Application Features**
   - Admin: Test reservation creation, guest management
   - Guest: Test property search and booking flow
   - Staff: Test task management
   - Backend: Test all API endpoints

### **Phase 2: Proper Deployment**
1. **Create production builds**
2. **Deploy to CT101 replacing demo containers**
3. **Configure proper networking and database connections**
4. **Test end-to-end workflows**

### **Phase 3: Cyprus Feature Validation**
1. **Test VAT calculations and reporting**
2. **Verify police registration workflows**
3. **Test JCC payment integration**
4. **Validate SMS notifications**
5. **Check multi-language support**

### **Phase 4: Original Vision Alignment**
1. **Document all implemented features**
2. **Compare against original PMS requirements**
3. **Identify gaps and missing functionality**
4. **Create improvement roadmap**

## 🎯 Expected Outcomes

By the end of this validation:
- **Clear picture** of what's actually implemented vs what's placeholder
- **Working applications** deployed and accessible
- **Feature completeness report** against original vision
- **Demo-ready platform** with real data and workflows
