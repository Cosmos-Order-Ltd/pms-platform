### TASK-052: Multi-Vector Geofencing for Development Sites
**File:** `real-estate-platform/src/services/SiteGeofencing.ts:20-35`
**Code:**
```typescript
async createDevelopmentSiteGeofence(project: Project): Promise<GeofenceConfig> {
  // TODO: Implement complex geofencing for development sites
  // Requirements: Irregular boundaries, construction zones, access points
}
```
**Question:** How should geofencing work for development sites vs. simple hotel properties?
**Development Site Requirements:**
1. Irregular property boundaries (not circular)
2. Multiple access points for construction
3. Restricted areas during construction phases
4. Safety zones around active construction
5. Investor site visit verification
